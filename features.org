* Features to add to this repository

This file is intended to guide myself into what I want to add


1. This one could be big: Write an elisp extension that can wrap the
   region inside keywords such as try/catch, if, if/else, def(..):,
   etcetera. I've wanted it for so long it hurts not to have it. I used
   it all the time in Pycharm/IntelliJ. It was bound to C-M-t. I'll
   definetly write this one.
2. Do something about the Gtk autocompletion in Python. It's not
   working and it really annoys me. Maybe i could auto-generate an
   abbrev table or something.
3. Write an importmagic package for python mode. It hurts to have it
   Atom, Sublime Text and Elpy and to not have it in Emacs (at least
   not as an standalone package)
