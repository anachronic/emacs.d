* Features to add to this repository

This file is intended to guide myself into what I want to add

- Fix elpy-format-code. Either leave the point where it is or at least
  push mark before
- Bind paredit-kill to an *easy* key. I've been using it outside elisp
  so much it hurts to M-x each time
- This one could be big: Write an elisp extension that can wrap the
  region inside keywords such as try/catch, if, if/else, def(..):,
  etcetera. I've wanted it for so long it hurts not to have it. I used
  it all the time in Pycharm/IntelliJ. It was bound to C-M-t. I'll
  definetly write this one.
- Do something about the Gtk autocompletion in Python. It's not
  working and it really annoys me. Maybe i could auto-generate an
  abbrev table or something.
- Try out anaconda-mode
- Bind counsel-git to something. It looks way more useful than
  projectile's
