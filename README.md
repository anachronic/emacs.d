Man, this was a long journey. I'm still grateful for all the experience this
repo gave me and how it opened my world to rapid text editing with Emacs.
Unfortunatly, I feel like emacs hasn't been able to fullfill the needs of modern
developers when it comes to certain workflows. Can't really edit Vue very well,
never got LSP to work, and the world has shifted to those technologies. It's a
shame, because I've spent an awful amount of time maintaining this emacs config.
But I can't do it anymore.

Farewell, Emacs community. It was a blast. It really was.
