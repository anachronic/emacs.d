;; I'd like to have a cool prefix key to do my own things without
;; having to worry that anyone overrides its key binding and, as you
;; know, C-c is quite cluttered. So, let's rebind C-a to combine M-m
;; and C-a and voil√†!, we get a free cool key to bind to a prefix.
;; The rebinding happens in setup-editor.el
(global-unset-key (kbd "M-m"))
(define-prefix-command 'meta-m-map)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-m") 'meta-m-map)

;; There are some files I like to jump to. C-x j seems like a sensible
;; prefix for this.
