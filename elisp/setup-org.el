;;; setup-org.el --- Setup org mode in Emacs.
;;; Commentary:
;;; Code:

;; Honestly this section deserves attention once I USE org mode. I've
;; been doing it so i get packages and configure them but never
;; actually use them. This is no way to start any kind of project nor
;; is it a way to get packages. I'll get stuff once I need the stuff

(provide 'setup-org)
;;; setup-org.el ends here
